Credit card fraud is a term that has been coined for unauthorized access of payment cards like credit cards or debit cards to pay for using services or goods. The objective of Credit Card Fraud Detection is to accurately identify fraudulent transactions from a large pool of credit card transactions by building a predictive model based on past transaction data. This project includes data pre-processing, scaling of 'amount' column in original dataset, under-sampling of data to handle data imbalance, splitting data into train and test data and finally applying various machine learning algorithms to classify the transactions.
